NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Cache - Caching layer for Catalyst
    Sessions

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/Session Session::Store::Cache Session::Store::Something/;

        MyApp->config->{session} = {
            cache => {
                driver => 'Memory',
                seconds => 300
            }
        };

DESCRIPTION
    `Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Cache' sits atop your existing
    session store, caching sessions reads and writes. The `seconds'
    configuration option provides the number of seconds that the session is
    allowed to be "stale". Failure of the underlying cache during this time
    would result in lost data, but that might be ok with you if it speeds
    things up.

    CHI is used as the underlying cache, so the `driver' option must be a
    driver that CHI will recognize.
